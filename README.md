# Uber Data Analysis
A comprehensive Power BI project that analyzes an Uber dataset, and I'm thrilled to share the insights and visualizations I created. Here's a brief overview of what I did:

# 🔄 Data Cleaning:

- Utilized Power Query to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and change the data types for the START_DATE and END_DATE fields.

# 🔢 Calculated Fields:

- Created new fields including Start_Time and End_Time by extracting the time from the START_DATE and END_DATE columns.

- Calculated Trip_Duration by determining the difference between Start_Time and End_Time.

# 📊 Visualizations:

## Report Page: Focused on key business metrics such as:

- Total trips, Total purposes, Average miles per trip and Average trip duration in minutes

- Charts:
Trips by category
Number of trips by month
Longest trips in mile
Most common purposes

## Geographic Details Page:
Showcased geographical insights with:

- A map representing the geographic distribution of trip origins.

- A table listing start locations and the number of trips from those locations.
