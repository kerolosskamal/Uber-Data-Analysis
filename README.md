# Uber-Data-Analysis
A comprehensive Power BI project that analyzes an Uber dataset, and I'm thrilled to share the insights and visualizations I created. Here's a brief overview of what I did:

ðŸ”„ Data Cleaning:

Utilized Power Query to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and change the data types for the START_DATE and END_DATE fields.

ðŸ”¢ Calculated Fields:

Created new fields including Start_Time and End_Time by extracting the time from the START_DATE and END_DATE columns.

Calculated Trip_Duration by determining the difference between Start_Time and End_Time.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations:

-Report Page: Focused on key business metrics such as:

Total trips, Total purposes, Average miles per trip and Average trip duration in minutes

Charts:
Trips by category
Number of trips by month
Longest trips in mile
Most common purposes

-Geographic Details Page: Showcased geographical insights with:

A map representing the geographic distribution of trip origins.

A table listing start locations and the number of trips from those locations.

This project not only honed my data cleaning and analysis skills but also enhanced my ability to create insightful visualizations that drive business decisions.
